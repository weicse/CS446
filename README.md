# CS 446 - Operating Systems

My project implementations for CS 446 at UNR, Spring 2018.

## Getting Started

Simply use the makefile to compile the programs and run. A config file argument is needed, eg:
```
./sim01 config_1.conf
```
Individual project descriptions can be found in PDF format within each project directory.
